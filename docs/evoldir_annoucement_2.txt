Dear all,

We're pleased to announce the release of PartitionFinder v1.1.1. 
This version contains a number of major improvements over previous
versions, including the ability to rapidly analyse genomic datasets.

PartitionFinder is a program that allows for the combined selection
of partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for DNA
and amino acid datasets. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

It is available here: 

www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder

Version 1.1.1 includes a number of improvements:

    * Support for very large datasets (1000s of genes, 1000s of taxa)
    * Faster algorithms
    * Support for partitioning scheme searches using RAxML
    * Improved memory efficiency
    * Output of the best partitioning scheme in RAxML format
    * A number of bug fixes and other minor improvements
    
A full description of all the methods can be found in the manual, along
with some hints on the best method to use for datasets of different sizes. 
The methods are more fully described and compared in an in prep paper.

Please get in touch if you have questions, suggestions, or comments.

Yours,

Rob Lanfear & Brett Calcott
